* Introducing represent

The Go language developers created [[present][http://talks.golang.org/2012/go-docs.slide#21]], a really nice slide presentation
tool with a clean look. Presentations are defined in a simple text-based format similar to wiki markup.

Much better than Powerpoint, or Google Drive for that matter. You can check it into revision control.

present serves up pages in an HTTP server. It's great for live demonstrations
of code.

I liked the simple clean look of Present, so I adapted it for static HTML page generation.

* Installation

1. Install the Go language tools.

2. Set up your $GOPATH. Add $GOPATH/bin to your $PATH.

3. Download and install:

  $ go get github.com/cmars/represent/cmd/represent
  $ go install github.com/cmars/represent/cmd/represent

* Usage

Create .slide and .article files in the Present format
described here: [[http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.talks/pkg/present]].

Use represent to compile all the Present files in the current
working directory to a hierarchy of static html pages,
in a 'publish' subdirectory.

Use represent -basedir <dir> to target a directory tree of Present files
elsewhere.

represent's documentation was compiled with represent. Mmm dogfood!
